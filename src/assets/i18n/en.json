  "aboutUs.text3": "Our choice, of course,  fell on the Dobermann breed. A great search for suitable breeding stations began. At the time of collecting information, we got acquainted with the CHS European K9 training base. We had decided that one of our puppy's parents would be from this station.",
  "aboutUs.text4": "We wanted an eager female dog with parents of the nature quite opposite to our introverted male.",

  "aboutUs.text7": "The training process and the amazing progress made with Legenda awoke the desire to have our own puppies, that finally resulted in founding a breeding station.",
  "aboutUs.text8": "In June 2022, we founded the kennel Vita Amoris with the aim of preserving Legenda's playfulness, ferocity and el√°n in the puppies, and to devote ourselves to the business of breeding of this beautiful and elegant canine with an emphasis on health and agility.",
